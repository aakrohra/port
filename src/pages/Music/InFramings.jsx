            <p className='bandText'>In Framings is an indie rock band I started 4 years ago. It has
                served as my main creative outlet and a chance to lead a project, connect with
                a local community, and grow as both a musician and organizer. As the primary contact
                for booking and events, I learned the value of professionalism, clear communication,
                and networking in a fast-moving scene.<br></br><br></br>Photo by Cole London. Edited by me.
