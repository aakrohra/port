                    student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science and English. I spend my time outside of those fields
                    on my music projects and graphic design work. <br></br><br></br> I've titled this collection "Sensory Memory", an idea I've grown attached to. Hopefully
                    something you see here will stick around for longer, but at least you will have learned a little about who I am. <br></br><br></br>Have a good day.
